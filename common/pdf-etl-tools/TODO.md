Issues or Improvements To Do

  * Previous functionality for updating (re-running invokers) the database

        add-raw --upsert

    is no longer working (thanks to the improvement of now having uniqueness
    constraints on our collection).

  * See the FIXMEs in the code.

  * The command line interface could be upgraded to use names rather than
    integers for referring to invokers.
