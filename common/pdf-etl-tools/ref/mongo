** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database

- Documents in a document store are roughly equivalent to the programming
  concept of an object. They are not required to adhere to a standard schema,
  nor will they have all the same sections, slots, parts or keys.

- Documents are addressed in the database via a unique key that represents that
  document. This key is a simple identifier (or ID), typically a string, a URI,
  or a path.

** BSON

BSON /ˈbiːsən/ is a computer data interchange format. The name "BSON" is based
on the term JSON and stands for "Binary JSON".[2]. It is a binary form for
representing simple or complex data structures including associative arrays
(also known as name-value pairs), integer indexed arrays, and a suite of
fundamental scalar types. BSON originated in 2009 at MongoDB.
